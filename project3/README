In the script sub-folder you'll find the .C macro that was used to perform the classifcation and generate the evaluation plots.
Inside you find a naviagator to what each individual scipt does. Code was developed together with external partners: Ding Y. and Song Y. (EPFL-LPHE)

Preselected event data and truthmatched MC simulation are found inside rootfiles
(unfortunately: the all event file sizes are too large to be stored in the repository.
If needed send mail to alexander.umansky@fys.uio.no to ask for zip files
