Script Naviagation:

The Macro is designed to work with Snakefile. The snakefile determines the pipleine and administers which file-outputs are send forward as inputs (which scripts to run with which root files)
The file sytem is categorized as follows: tree (data/mc) -> channel (D2H/D4H) -> track (LL/DD) -> polarization (MD/MU)
There are 4 classifcation scripts and 4 application scripts for 4 classifiers. 
The only difference (between chennels) in the scripts is: the name of the function and the the .C file itself 
(hence we present only the D4H and D2H file combination)
The difference between D2H, D4H is the number of descriptor variables used for the classifers, the cuts, splitting and method are the same, configuration are possible to make individually

The Classification Gude file shows the relevant midel configurations that were used for the report. 
Only this parts need to be changed in order to re-run the analysis with different classification models

The evaluation scripts evaluation.C is used after sucessfully running the classifcation.C This code generates the overtrain-KS and ROC plots
Evaluation_DNN.C is used to apply a single score cut (This was primarily used for DNN but also aplicable to any classification output with score_variable
FOM_scan.C is used to determine the optimal BDT cut for AdamptiveBoost
